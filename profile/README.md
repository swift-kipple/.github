# Kipple

**Kipple** is a collection of Swift modules providing common Swift functionality for rapid prototyping, quick reference, education, discovery, and personal use, covering concepts from logging to error handling to running Swift excutables and more.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All **Kipple** modules can now be found at [`bdrelling/Kipple`](https://github.com/bdrelling/Kipple).
>
> This was mostly done to save money for things priced by GitHub organization (like GitHub Actions and so on), but also for ease of development as it's currently just me working on these modules.
