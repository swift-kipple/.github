## Kipple

**Kipple** is a collection of Swift packages and plugins providing common Swift functionality for getting your projects off the ground, with the hope of doubling as a discovery resource for the implementation of real-world product development concepts such as: analytics, diagnostics, crash reporting, ci/cd, push notifications, and more.

As this collection of packages grows, we hope to include open-source applications (published to the App Store) that show how these features have been implemented, with as much visibility and transparency into the entire process as possible.

### What does "Kipple" mean?

The concept of "**Kipple**" comes from the [Philip K. Dick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick) book [_Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep%3F).

> **Kipple** is useless objects, like junk mail or match folders after you use the last match or gum wrappers of yesterday's homeopape. **When nobody's around, kipple reproduces itself.** For instance, if you go to bed leaving any kipple around your apartment, when you wake up the next morning there's twice as much of it. It always gets more and more.

> No one can win against kipple, except temporarily and maybe in one spot,[...] It's a universal principle operating throughout the universe; the entire universe is moving toward a final state of total, absolute kippleization.

With every new project, we write a lot of the same boilerplate code again and again, and it piles up quickly. It's not _useless_ code, but it's usually fairly simple solutions repeated over and over per-project that never warrant pulling in bloated third-party dependencies.

The goal is for Kipple to become a one-stop shop for lightweight, _temporary_ dependencies and discoverable solutions.
